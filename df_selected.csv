Sells Californication

And buy me a star on the boulevard

Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population everybody's been there and
I don't mean on vacation
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar

And tidal waves couldn't save the world

You snort it like a champ, like the winner when I'm in it...

And watch you call his name
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, Leave him for me.

I'm in love with you and you will never know,

Feelin' low down (down), not a lot to do around here
I thought that I would go right out of my mind
Until a friend told me the news

Right beside the gas station? Well, somebody bought it
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop
Where we can go buy bolts and screws""
Since then I've been walking on air (air)
I can barely brush my teeth or comb my hair
'Cause I'm so excited and I really don't care
I've been waiting since last June
For this day to finally arrive
I'm so happy (happy) now just to be alive
'Cause any minute now I'm gonna be inside
Well, I hope they open soon
In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight
Right in front of the store, then as soon as it was light out
I pressed my nose right up against the glass
You know, I had to be first in line
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house
See those hacksaws? Very, very soon
One of them will be all mine
Guys with nametags walking down the aisles
Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles
All arranged alphabetically
And they're doing a promotional stunt
There's a great big purple sign out front
That says every 27th customer
Will get a ball-peen hammer free
Would you look at all that stuff ...

Picture hangers, paper cutters, waffle irons, window shutters
Paint removers, window louvres, masking tape and plastic gutters
Kitchen faucets, folding tables, weather stripping, jumper cables
Hooks and tackle, grout and spackle, power foggers, spoons and ladles
Pesticides for fumigation, high-performance lubrication
Metal roofing, water proofing, multi-purpose insulation
Air compressors, brass connectors, wrecking chisels, smoke detectors
Tire gauges, hamster cages, thermostats and bug deflectors

And you loosed the chains

For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,
""Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!""
Realized he'd been gettin' the raw deal
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddie Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, ""It tastes just like chicken!""
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts
There's the National Guard and the F. B. I.
There's a van from the Eyewitness News
And helicopters circling around in the sky
And the bullets are flying, the body count's rising
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?
My my my my my my
You used to be such a jolly guy
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights
They're talkin' 'bout
The night St. Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See that roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-oo
Caroline!(Caroline!) See she's the reason for the word ""bitch""(Bitch!)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, craaash.. into a ditch! (Just Playing!)
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it takes to look inside and realize that
Well she's got a hotty's body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said ""Pardon me, are you ballin'?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pursing""
Oh so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game, been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek, ah, quick way to eat,
Ah, neat place sleep, ah, rent-a-car for a week, ah, trick for a treat..Noo
Go, on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved without our lawyers
And judges, just to hold grudges in the courtroom,
I want to see ya support bra not support you!

When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head
On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him 'til morning
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me
In the rain the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever
And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say, there's a way for us
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river
The world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers
But every day I'm learning
All my life
I've only been pretending
Without me
His world would go on turning
A world that's full of happiness

And the camels buried in a big straw stack
[Chorus]
Well I'm from
A map dot
A stop sign on a blacktop
I caught the first bus, I could hop from there
But all o' this glitter is gettin' dark
There's concrete glowin' in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
And there's bars on the corner and bars on my heart
Whoa where the green grass grows",contemporary country,$G$

That you'll never loose

Skeleton guns
Or wedding bells in the attic

Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels

That no one knows about
He says it used to be a farm
Before the Motor Law
And now on Sundays I elude the eyes
And hop the turbine freight
To far outside the wire where my
White-haired uncle waits
Jump to the ground as the turbo slows
To cross the borderline
Run like the wind as excitement shivers
Up and down my spine
But down in his barn
My uncle preserved for me
An old machine
For fifty-odd years
To keep it as new
Has been his dearest dream
I strip away the old debris
That hides a shining car
A brilliant Red Barchetta
From a better vanished time
We'll fire up the willing engine
Responding with a roar
Tires spitting gravel
I commit my weekly crime
Wind
In my hair
Shifting and drifting
Mechanical music
Adrenaline surge
Well-oiled leather
Hot metal and oil
The scented country air
Sunlight on chrome
The blur of the landscape
Every nerve aware
Suddenly ahead of me
Across the mountainside
A gleaming alloy air-car
Shoots towards me two lanes wide
Oh, I spin around with shrieking tires
To run the deadly race
Go screaming through the valley
As another joins the chase
Ride like the wind
Straining the limits
Of machine and man
Laughing out loud with fear and hope
I've got a desperate plan
At the one-lane bridge
I leave the giants stranded
At the riverside
Race back to the farm
To dream with my uncle

Pull up in your fast car whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here and play a video game
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss put his favorite perfume on
Go play your video game
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the red lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.

They had to count them all

Chase you down until you love me

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound

Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Savin' it up, for Friday night
With the Sultans
We're the Sultans of Swing
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans
Yeah the Sultans they play creole, creole
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
Goodnight, now it's time to go home
And he makes it fast with one more thing

Growing darkness taking dawn

I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,
Dial the combination, open the priest hole
And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines.
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.

But Mommy's neither one of those
I've known her all these years
Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year
Every time I got to thinking
Where'd they disappear
Then I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling
Got my Kiss records out

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Can't hold it back anymore
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
I am one with the wind and sky
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go and
I'll rise like the break of dawn

And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn,
To win some or learn some
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We are just one big family
And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
It cannot wait I'm yours
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't

The signals grow on radios
All the strange things
They come and go, as early warnings
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide
There's no point in direction we cannot
Even choose a side.
I took the old track
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
On the tall cliffs
They were getting older, sons and daughters
The jaded underworld was riding high
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
And as the nail sunk in the cloud, the rain
Was warm and soaked the crowd.
When the flood calls
You have no home, you have no walls
In the thunder crash
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
The actors gone, there's only you and me
And if we break before the dawn, they'll
Use up what we used to be.",album rock,$C♯/D♭$

No one, would ever have you again

Your heart securely tied and bound
Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night
But too many opponents made you weary of the fight
Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in
All the warnings went off in your head
Still you had to give in
Resistance nowhere to be found
But promises, you know what they're for
It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before
Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure
And so you put up your guard
And you try to be hard
But your heart says try again
You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear

Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost

And it's the only thing that I know, know.

trying hard to piece together a broken dream.
His visions lifelike and full of imagination
it's strange to think they came from such a tiny head.
Dragons breathing fire, but friendly.
Mushrooms tall as houses.
Giant Nymphs and goblins playing,
Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime
they always made him have these nightmares, it seemed.
Helped young Washington in the garden,
cut the cherry tree down.
Now we all know that's not history,
Once he went to the 'Carnival of Nations'
dancing with the princess through the night.
Found themselves on a moving platform
ten ton weights above them,
seeking audience with King Morpheus.

Undemanding contact
In your happy solitude
Invisible airwaves
Crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle
With the energy
Emotional feedback
On a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price,
Almost free
All this machinery
Making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question
Of your honesty
One likes to believe
In the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion
Of integrity

Echoes with the sounds, of salesmen",album rock,$E$

The distance in my voice

Ran to hide behind the stairs

The songwriter?s dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica,
Of Innocence
Empathica
Innocence
The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
My home was there and then
These meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free
Tuck me in
Beneath the blue
Beneath the pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all
I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped
Again and again and again
I know I will die alone, but loved
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
And if you want
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
Years have I been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death
I always longed for
Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infacticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell
The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came
Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Thomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text
Save me!
Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such ocean's within
In the end
I will always love you

The future seemed so bright,
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
But that's alright because I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie
[Rihanna's Part 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
And this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right.
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
[Rihanna's Part 3]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories
[Eminem's Part]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it
But that's alright because",dance pop,$A♯/B♭$

Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
Here I am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Just seeing you, it kills me now

Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong

Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Just seeing you, it kills me now
Now I don't cry

The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
But there's more things I have to do
Don't tell me that this is the end",album rock,$F$

And a million miles

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well

Where nothing ever happened?

Two young lovers with nothin' better to do
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
And here is what happened when they decided to cut loose
They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso
That's where they ran into a great big hassle
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
Bobbie Sue took the money and run
Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his livin' off of the people's taxes
Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day
They got the money, hey
You know they got away

Oh, no one knows
Until you lose your hair
But you don't care, yeah
Can you tell me? oh
Can you tell me? oh yeah
Can you tell me? (If it's going to be a daisy or a rose?)
You don't know
You don't know, oh
Yeah, yeah

The lightning all around me

As time began to blur
Like a startling sign

Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny

Wants to head it south in May,
Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n' roll man,
Somewhere down Montserrat way.

Everything is so provocative
Very very, temporary
I shall walk (I shall walk)
Out of this place (out of this place)
I shall walk
Out on you
'Cause you go silly
If she's willing
Trying so hard to be like the big boys
So you take her to the pictures
Trying to become a fixture
Inch by inch trying to reach her
All the way through the second feature
Worrying about your physical fitness
Tell me how you got this sickness, oh ohhhh..
I was caught in the suction
By a face like a truncheon
I was down upon one knee
Stroking her vanity
I was stuck on a hammerhead
I came alive and left for dead
As my face returned to red
Choking on my pride and pity
We can talk (we can talk)
Until your face is blue ('til your face is blue)
We can talk but she'll get to you
After you've been loved and hated
By the ones you've watched and waited
Found that they were overrated
She'll be the one - when the party's over
She'll be the one - when the girls have gone home
She'll be the one - that you'll wish you'd held onto
She'll be the one - but it's too late for you to
She'll be the one - who knows all your history
She'll be the one -
So you can cross her off your list
To be like the big boys, oh.",art rock,$A$

Hey
You gotta bounce to it like this
You almost gotta walk to this
Uh huh
Escape
Boy your love's so good
I don't want to let go
And although I know I should
I can't leave you alone
Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist
And oh
[Repeat x11]
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all
She want to shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends
She want to creep past the block spyin' again
She want to roll with Jay, chase the skeeos away
She want to fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She want to inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find a strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the new crib
She want to answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She call me ""Heartbreaker""
When we apart, it makes her
Want to get a piece of paper, scribble ""I hate ya""
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does

grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.

Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled
""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say

Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.
And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song,
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled
""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea,
Eventually",album rock,$B$

A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep

Better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
